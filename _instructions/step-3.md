# Step 3: Iterators

## Building a List

Looping through content is at the heart of the web. Blogs, comments, products, reviews, images, tweets, posts, pins...you name it. We never know the number of items needing to be displayed when we write our component, so we need to be able to loop through as many are provided.

1. Passing in array content
2. Iterating through items with v-for="item in items"
3. Why do we need a key?
4. Slot content vs putting TodoItem inside List
5. Passing item to slot

## Building the TodoItem

1. Composite components vs atomic components
2. Knowledge of application needs. Self aware
3. Passing Textfield and button emits up
